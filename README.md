# 🗺️ Flora 🌺

[**Flora**](https://flora-qwia.onrender.com) is a react website that makes learning about plants easy. You just click on a country somewhere on the map, and then flashcards appear, and you can start having fun.
I am slowly increasing the number of flashcards available, day by day, please be patient.

Clickable countries :
- France
